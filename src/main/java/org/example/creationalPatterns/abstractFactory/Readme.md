**Core Idea**

The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's like having a "factory of factories."

**Scenario: Furniture Store**

Imagine you're building software for a furniture store that offers furniture in different styles (Modern, Victorian, Art Deco).

**Components**

* **Abstract Furniture Factory (Interface):**
    * `createChair()`
    * `createSofa()`
    * `createCoffeeTable()`

* **Concrete Factories:**
    * **ModernFurnitureFactory** (Implements AbstractFurnitureFactory)
    * **VictorianFurnitureFactory** (Implements AbstractFurnitureFactory)
    * **ArtDecoFurnitureFactory** (Implements AbstractFurnitureFactory)

* **Abstract Products:**
    * **Chair** (Interface)
    * **Sofa** (Interface)
    * **CoffeeTable** (Interface)

* **Concrete Products:**
    * **ModernChair** (Implements Chair)
    * **VictorianSofa** (Implements Sofa)
    * **ArtDecoCoffeeTable** (Implements CoffeeTable)


**How It Works**

1. The client interacts with an Abstract Factory.
2. The client requests a set of related products (e.g., chair, sofa, coffee table of a specific style).
3. The Abstract Factory delegates creation to the appropriate Concrete Factory.
4. The Concrete Factory produces a family of products that share a common theme.

**Benefits**

* **Encapsulates object creation:** Hides how concrete products are created and assembled.
* **Interchangeable families:** You can switch between families of products at runtime.
* **Enforces consistency:**  All products within a family share a common style and work well together.
